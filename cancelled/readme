These are projects that I stopped working on for whatever reason. Very broken, don't expect things to work.

What's here:

Azezal:
Old Doom mapping project, didn't get into it. There was a older verison of it but now it is lost. 

Dumb Mapping Project:
Another old Doom mapping project, stopped workin on it around the start of 2022. The first level is complete. 

Make a Doom Map Pack In 11 days:
Speed-mapping project to release on my birthday. Didn't finsh it as I got horribly sick later on. 

Mood! MOOOO!
Terrible maps, very unfinshed. 

strife:
Rebel Conquest with all its gory. Didn't finsh it for some reason.
